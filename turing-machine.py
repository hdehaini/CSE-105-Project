# This is a Turing Machine that accepts {a, b}âˆ—
# If the input string strats and ends with the same character, it adds a "ab" at the end of the string
# If the input string does not start and end with the same character, it removes the last character of the string
# If the input string is empty, it adds an "a" to the end of the string
# With these conditions, there will be a mapped string that is longer and shorter than the input string
